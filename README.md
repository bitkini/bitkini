# Bitkini Core ($KINI)

**Bitkini** is a lightweight, meme-tier Bitcoin fork built for sunseekers, cypherpunks, and hash-slingers.  
Block time: **60 seconds**  
Block reward: **69 $KINI**  
Halving: **Every 210,000 blocks (~145 days)**  
Max supply: **31,351,500 $KINI (hard cap)**  
Consensus: **Proof-of-Work (SHA256d)**  
Difficulty Adjustment: **Every block (Dogecoin-style)**  

This is a living blockchain. Fast blocks, scarce supply, real mining.  
A party chain you can build, mine, and run.

## 🔸 Download Wallet (Windows)

The fastest way to get started is to grab the **prebuilt GUI wallet** for Windows:  
👉 [https://bitkini.lol](https://bitkini.lol)

With the Bitkini Core wallet you can:
- Create new wallets & addresses
- Send and receive $KINI
- Run a full node (optional)
- No command line needed

If you're paranoid (good), feel free to run it in a Windows VM for security.
Please note the wallet is unsigned - we are waiting for a Code Signing Certificate from the foundation.

## 🧱 Run a Full Node

Want to build from source, run a node, or contribute directly to the chain?

Follow our official guide to compile and run Bitkini Core on **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**:  
👉 [https://bitkini.lol/full-node](https://bitkini.lol/full-node)

This guide includes:
- Dependencies & build steps  
- Starting your node with `bitkinid`  
- Connecting to peers and syncing  
- Wallet tips for devs & power users

## 🔄 Presale & Funding

Bitkini is a grassroots project — no VC, no premine shenanigans.  
We’re raising funds for **exchange listings** through an on-chain **BTC → $KINI** swap.

Swap instantly at:  
👉 [https://bitkini.lol](https://bitkini.lol)

You’ll receive $KINI in your wallet automatically after 2 confirmations.

This supports the project **directly** — listings, infrastructure, and growth.

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

If you want to compile from source manually, follow the standard Bitcoin Core build process.  
We’ve forked from Bitcoin Core v29 — all modern BIPs (SegWit, Taproot, etc.) are live.

Build guides are located in [`/doc/`](doc/). Start with:
- [`build-unix.md`](doc/build-unix.md)
- [`build-windows.md`](doc/build-windows.md)
